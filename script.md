Welcome to **Coachlens**, a coach’s trusted AI assistant for player analysis and team selection.

Coachlens is a data driven analytics platform designed to help soccer coaches make smarter player assessments and more confident squad planning decisions.

### Squad Boost

Our first module is **Squad Boost**.

This feature allows coaches to evaluate their squad and quickly identify under performers, over performers, and under used high impact players based on season contribution.

For example, when analyzing Aston Villa, our platform highlighted **Marco Asensio** and **Ross Barkley** as under used players. Both demonstrated high Impact Scores but had relatively low game time, suggesting untapped potential within the squad.

We also curate an optimized high impact lineup to simplify team selection decisions.

This view is powered by our engineered metric, **Impact Score**, which aggregates key contribution factors such as progressive actions, chance creation, defensive involvement, and overall influence on match outcomes.

### Player Profiler

Next is the **Player Profiler**.

This tool enables coaches to filter players by position or squad and benchmark their performance against others in the league. It also clusters players with similar statistical profiles, helping coaches understand the type of role or tactical identity a player fits into.

This makes it easier to answer questions such as:

* Is this player an elite creator or a system dependent contributor?
* Which players in the league share a similar performance fingerprint?

### Talent Scout

The **Talent Scout** module provides league wide leaderboards across detailed performance metrics. Coaches can identify top performers in specific attributes, supporting smarter recruitment decisions.

To complement this, the **Transfer Guide** recommends players most similar to a selected target, based on playstyle, impact metrics, and defined parameters.

For example, when searching for **Gabriel Martinelli**, the system generates comparable players ranked by similarity score.

In fact, during a subsequent transfer window, **Arsenal F.C.** signed **Noni Madueke**  in the following transfer window as a backup to Martinelli!.

### Player Fatigue Alert System

Finally, Coachlens addresses one of modern football’s biggest challenges: injury management.

With increasing match loads, non contact injuries have risen significantly. Many elite players have been labeled injury prone due to poor workload management.

<!-- 
Consider **Ousmane Dembele**, who was once criticized for recurring injuries. With structured minute management and smarter load control, he went on to win the **UEFA Champions League** and later the **Ballon d'Or**. -->

Inspired by this, we developed a **Player Fatigue Alert System**.

This system:

* Analyzes each player’s injury history
* Correlates minutes played, fouls received, and workload intensity
* Generates a fatigue risk score

These insights allow managers to proactively manage minutes, reduce injury risk, and protect long term player availability.

Coachlens equips coaches with performance intelligence, recruitment clarity, and injury foresight, all in one unified analytics platform designed to turn data into competitive advantage.
